<h2>Solung</h2>
						
<p><br>An agriculture festival, Solung is celebrated in the month of monsoon (July /August). This 10 days festival is amongst the most famous festivals in North East India, especially celebrated by the Adi community in West Siang district, East Siang district, Lower Dibang Valley district, Upper Dibang Valley district and Upper Siang  district of Arunachal Pradesh. The date for the festival is different each year and is decided by Kebang or the village council keeping the convenience of the villagers in mind and once the date is fixed the preparation of the local beer Apong starts. On the first day, the Indian Bison along with pigs are slaughtered in the early hours of the morning. On the second day, 1/3rd of the meat is distributed among the relatives; also a grand dinner feast is arranged for neighbours, women and children. On the 
 fourth day of the festival which is also called the Oinnyad, one of family member goes to the field and sacrifices a fowl especially for ‘Kine Nane’. On the seventh day or Ekob, men assemble at the village dormitory known as ‘Mosup’ to make bows and arrows, which are then fastened on the doors of every house in the village. On the tenth and final day of the festival, village people uproot the weak plants of paddy that get spoiled by worms and insects and this process is known as Irni. This act is done in the hope that ‘Kine Nane’ (the Goddess) will drive away the worms and insects out of the fields</p>
