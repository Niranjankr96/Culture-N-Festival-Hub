<h2>Amarnath Yatra</h2>
						
<p><br>Amarnath yatra is the most revered pilgrimage in Hinduism, one which every Hindu aspires to embark on once in his lifetime. This religious Yatra is organized every year to the great Himalayas, by the government of Jammu and Kashmir. The Amarnath tour is attended by thousands of domestic and international devotees. Interestingly, the main  cave temple site is located at a height of 12,756 feet from the sea level and is around 141 km away from the state’s capital city, Srinagar. Though the Yatra is physically  taxing, pilgrims put in a lot of effort to complete the holy tour of the scenic Amarnath caves. The Yatra can be undertaken along two routes- Baltal to Amarnath Cave and Pahalgam to Amarnath cave.</p>
